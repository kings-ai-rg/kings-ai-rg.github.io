**[Avyav Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avyav-kumar-singh/)** presented the collection of papers that elucidate Generative Flow Networks {% cite hu2023amortizing %} {% cite bengio2023gflownet %}, {% cite madan2023learning %} and {% cite malkin2022trajectory %}. 

**_Abstract_**

This talk explored the development of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets). We dissucssed how the use of amortized Bayesian inference to sample intractable posteriors, achieved through LLMs fine-tuning and diversity prioritised reinforcement learning algorithms enables data-efficient adaptation of LLMs.
