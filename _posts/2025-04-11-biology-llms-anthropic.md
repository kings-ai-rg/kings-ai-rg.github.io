**[Nathalie Kirch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathaliekirch/)** Will be presenting an overview of the recent Anthropic release On the Biology of a Large Language Model{% cite lindsey2025biology %}.

**_Abstract_**

In this talk, we explore Anthropic Thread: On the Biology of a Large Language Model, a thought-provoking investigation into the internal structures, behaviors, and emergent properties of large language models (LLMs). Drawing a metaphor between biological systems and artificial intelligence, this presentation delves into how LLMs—like biological organisms—develop internal representations, organize "thought," and respond adaptively to stimuli.
